Jammy
=====

Jammy is a lightweight Node.js wrapper for the thisismyjam.com API.
See http://www.thisismyjam.com/developers/beta and http://www.thisismyjam.com/developers/faq for API details.

I built it for the That Was My Jam website.
http://thatwasmyjam.sharpshooterlabs.com/

The source for that will (soon) be at:
https://github.com/derekahmedzai/thatwasmyjam
